## Usedy

## Product Overview:

Usedy is a decentralised marketplace application designed to incentivise and empower individuals, recyclable/reusable material sellers, recyclable/reusable centres, companies, and other buyers to participate actively in sustainable waste management and recycling efforts. By leveraging blockchain technology, Usedy connects sellers offering recyclable/reusable materials with buyers in a transparent and rewarding ecosystem. Sellers list their recyclable/reuseable materials/products while the buyers make purchases of these recyclable/reuseable products using blockchain The users (the sellers and buyers) are rewarded with a token in the form of usedy points, which upon accumulation to a certain amount can be exchanged for a valuable token and used to purchase eco-friendly products, services, or carbon offset certificates.

## Problem Statement:

Efficient waste management and recycling remain a significant challenge worldwide. Finding recyclable/reusable materials for purchase and motivating sellers to participate in recycling efforts are persistent issues. There is a lack of transparency and incentives to drive recycling participation effectively. These challenges hinder progress in mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable carbon reduction goals.



## Proposed Solution:

Usedy addresses these challenges by providing a decentralised marketplace for recyclable/reusable materials, integrating blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions, and introducing a tokenised reward system in the form of GRP. The product leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize waste management and recycling, creating a solution that not only encourages participation but also promotes sustainability and environmental consciousness.
